# Arduino-Python Interface Examples using PyFirmata

Welcome to the Arduino-Python Interface Examples repository! This repository contains code examples and schematic diagrams for interfacing various components in Arduino with Python using PyFirmata.

## Components Included
- Servomotor
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Thermistor
- Potentiometer
- LED
- DC Motor
- One Digit 7-Segment Display
- Button

## Usage
Each subdirectory in the repository contains an example code for interfacing a specific component using PyFirmata. PyFirmata is a Python library for communicating with Arduino boards using a standard firmata protocol.

The code is written in Python and can be run on any system with PyFirmata and the necessary dependencies installed.

The schematic diagrams are also provided to give users a better understanding of how to connect the hardware components together.
